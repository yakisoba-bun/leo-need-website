# Design choices
## Typography

I chose to use the Noto font family for the website as I wanted to use a font that looked professional, while also looking good. I used Google Fonts to find the font, using the filters to look for "Feeling - Business" and "Feeling - Calm" fonts as my main criteria. The font in question was sourced from [here](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans?lang=en_Latn&categoryFilters=Feeling:%2FExpressive%2FCalm).

## Colour Scheme

I chose these colours for the website as I wanted to use different shades of blue for the primary and secondary colours, and a darker shade for the tertiary colour. I then wanted to use black and white as they contrast each other well and would help contribute to good accessibility and readability for the website.

I also utilised EightShapes Contrast Grid as it gave me an easy to understand visualisation of how my chosen colours would contrast each other and how I could best meet accessiblity needs with the colours chosen.

## Images

Images used for band members and the band logo are official material from the game Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE! feat. Hatsune Miku, sourced from [Sekaipedia](https://www.sekaipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

## Responsiveness

I chose to incorporate responsiveness through the use of Bootstrap's breakpoints for viewport size, using media queries to adjust the website based on the viewport size. The breakpoints used are shown below:
